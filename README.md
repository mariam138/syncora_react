## Introduction

Syncora is a web application designed to help improve your productivity and organisation in day to day life. It allows you to view all your events, tasks and any notes you write down all in one place, making everything easier to find.

This repository is for the front-end of the application, made using the React framework. The back-end of the project utilises the Django REST Framework. The repository for the back end can be found [here](https://github.com/mariam138/syncora_drf).
